title : "Lower Web-Stack"
description: "A strong lower web-stack is important not only to build strong web frameworks on top, but also to allow performance critical systems to reach deeper to squeeze out extra juice. Rust has a good support on HTTP servers, even an HTTP2 implementation, websockets and other protocols."
