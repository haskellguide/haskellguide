title : "External Web APIs"
description: "With many Web-Apps we want to reach farther than our locally hosted services and reach APIs hosted by other platforms and services outside our network. While there are a number of them, many are just first version and others (like Facebook) are still absent, leaving a lot of room for improvement."
